## How to play?

### Starting a game
* One player should create a room and share the room key to the other player
* The other player should enter the room key to join

#### Attacking player
Type in a phrase that the other user must type.
If no phrase is entered, the turn is skipped.

#### Defending player
Type in the displayed phrase. This is done by typing each word at a time and pressing space.
